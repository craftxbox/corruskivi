        this is a dialogue editor for the corru.observer dialogue syntax
        it allows you to create, edit, and preview dialogues.
        make memes, write mods, or just have fun with it
        the big box is where you write your dialogue in corru syntax
        press <span class="code">TEST</span> to show the entire dialogue immediately
        or you can press <span class="code">PREVIEW</span to start the dialogue from the beginning
        just like it would look in the game
        you can also press <span class="code">START</span> to show your dialogue as a memory stream

        how do i even write a dialogue?
    moth
        dialogues are written in a tree like structure.
        each line has indentation that defines its place in the tree.
        lines without any indentation are called branches
        these make up the main structure of the dialogue.
        under any branch, you can type an actor with a single level of indentation.
        that actor will speak the text that follows it.
        like this:<br/><br/><code>start<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hello world</code>
        this makes me say:
        hello world
        each line turns into its own message in the dialogue.
        so if you want to say something like:
        line 1
        line 2
        you can do this:<br/><br/><code>start<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line 2</code>

actors
    moth
        actors are the entities that can speak in a dialogue.
        they are defined by their name and a unique identifier.
        you can use the identifier to refer to them in the dialogue.
        i'm <span class="code">moth</span>, for example.

whatresponses
    moth
        responses are the options that the player can choose from.
        you define them like a special kind of actor.
        simply put <span class="code">RESPONSES::</span> then the name of the actor
        like this:<br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSES::self</code>
        almost always you will want to use the <span class="code">self</span> actor, but you can use other actors too
        then, you define the replies like this:<br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name&lt;+&gt;destination</code>
        <span class="code">name</span> is whats shown to the player, and <span class="code">destination</span> is the branch that they will end up in.
        you can also add multiple responses, with a different actor, and they'll show up at the same time.
        the responses you're about to see look like this:<br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSES::self<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fakeend&lt;+&gt;fakeend<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ok&lt;+&gt;syntax<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAKEEND::(back)</code>

    moth
        <span class="code">FAKEEND::</span> is a command that turns the response into the end buttons you see

commands
    moth
        commands are special lines that start with three levels of indentation (twelve spaces).
        they are used to define special actions in the dialogue.
        for example, you can use <span class="code">AUTOADVANCE::</span to make a dialogue line immediately go to the next line without waiting for the player to click.

        <span class="code">WAIT::</span> waits for an amount of milliseconds before letting the dialogue continue
        <span class="code">AUTOADVANCE::</span> will make the dialogue automatically advance to the next line without waiting for the player to click
        <span class="code">CLASS::</span> will add an HTML class to the dialogue line, which can be used for styling if you're making a mod.
        <span class="code">SHOWONCE::</span> will make the dialogue line or response only show once. once the player has seen it, it won't show up again
        <span class="code">CHANGE::</span> will change the chain to the one you specify after it. will cause an error if the chain doesn't exist

        <span class="code">FAKEEND::</span> only works on responses, it makes the response button look like an end button. it takes a string of text after it, which is what shows underneath the primary text
        <span class="code">HIDEREAD::</span> also only works in responses, it will hide if the response has been used before. It'll show up with a yellow underline like 'dynamic' responses

        the rest of these commands are normally blocked by your mindspike's safeties, but you can use them if you disable them in the advanced menu
        <span class="code">EXEC::</span> runs whatever javascript code you put after it
        <span class="code">THEN::</span> is like EXEC:: but it runs after a WAIT:: instead of immediately
        <span class="code">END::</span> is like EXEC:: but it runs when the dialogue ends.
        <span class="code">SKIP::</span> shows a button to allow skipping some or all of the dialogue, and runs like EXEC:: when pressed.<br><span class="code">SKIPNOTICE::</span> changes the text of the skip button, so you can make it say something else.<br/> <span class="code">SKIPTIME::</span> changes how long the 'skipping dialogue' screen gets shown for, in milliseconds.
        <span class="code">UNREADCHECK::</span> runs javascript to see if a response shows as unread or not
        you can find more information about <span class="code">SHOWIF::</span>, <span class="code">NESTIF::</span>, and <span class="code">RESPOBJ::</span> commands in the advanced section of the help menu

        definitions are how you can underline words in dialogue to add extra information
        like "INHERITED CONTEXT" in the game.
        they're pretty simple, just one replacement per line
        any word, followed by a colon, followed by the definition
        like this:<br/><br/><code>definitions:the thing you're reading right now</code>
        and then whenever i say "<span definition="the thing you're reading right now">definitions</span>", you can now hover over it to see that text.

customactors
    moth
        custom actors are a bit trickier
        you need to provide a "<span definition="Javascript Object Notation">JSON</span>" object with all the actors you want to add or override
        i can't explain the ins and outs of json here, but i can show you an example
        <code>{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"craftxbox":{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name":"craftxbox",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"image":"https://crxb.cc/snep.png",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type":"external moth"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>}</code>
        if you put this in the custom actors box and save, you can then use "craftxbox" as an actor id
    craftxbox
        and you would get this
    moth
        the <span class="code">type</span> adds classes to the actor's dialogue box, so you can style it differently
        unfortunately i can't show you all the types available but you can see what types existing actors have by looking at the "all actors" section

chains
    moth
        right, so up until now you've probably been writing dialogues in a single chain
        by default, the editor makes these into the <span class="code">editorpreview</span> chain
        and thats the chain that you see when you preview, or start
        but you can make more than that, which is mostly useful for mods
        by using <span class="code">@name whatever</span> at the <span class="code">start</span> of a dialogue, you define a new chain
        like this:<br/><br/><code>@name whatever<br/>start<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hello world</code>
        and you can switch chains by using <span class="code">CHANGE::whatever</span> as a response destination
        like this: <br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSES::self<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change chain&lt;+&gt;CHANGE::whatever</code>

respobj
    moth
        "RESPOBJ", or response objects are reusable responses that you can define once and use multiple times
        saves having to copy the same responses over and over again, lol
        probably arent going to be super useful to you unless you're making a mod
        you write them just like normal chains but instead of <span class="code">start</span> you use <span class="code">RESPOBJ::</span>
        just put <span class="code">@respobj whatever</span> before the <span class="code">RESPOBJ::</span>
        like this:<br/><br/><code>@respobj whatever<br/>RESPOBJ::<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSES::self<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example&lt;+&gt;branch</code>
        and then you can use them like in a branch this:<br/><br/><code>branch<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPOBJ::whatever</code>
        they work just like chains though, so make sure the only thing after them is a chain or another respobj
        or anything else will disappear and it'll be confusing

annotations
    moth
        annotations are a special comment that you can put in your dialogue
        these diverge from syntax a bit but they're easy to remove if needed
        they start with <span class="code">@</span> and have no indentation
        you can use them to add notes to your dialogue, but they have a more important use
        certain annotations will change how the dialogue is processed
        like <span class="code">@testpath</span> which tells the editor which responses to click on when testing
        or <span class="code">@background</span> changes what background is used

testpath
    moth
        normally when you preview a chain only the first branch is shown
        but you can use <span class="code">@testpath</span> to define a path that will be shown instead
        each pair of numbers after <span class="code">@testpath</span> tells the editor which response to click on
        so if you put <span class="code">@testpath 0,1</span>
        it will click the first reply of the first response menu.
        you can put as many pairs of numbers as you want, and it will click them in order
        like this: <span class="code">@testpath 0,1 1,0 0,2 2,2</span>
        but note you can only have one testpath, and it must be at the very top of your editor
        otherwise it will break everything

background
    moth
        so normally the editor uses no background
        all you get is a black void
        but if you want to spice it up a little, you can use the <span class="code">@background</span> annotation
        it takes a single argument, which is a link to an image
        like this: <span class="code">@background https://corru.observer/img/textures/ccontours.gif</span>
        and then the editor will use that image as the background
        there's also <span class="code">@foreground</span> which works the same way but it will display on top of the background
        useful for adding a 'mask' to the background
        typically this would be <span class="code">@foreground https://corru.observer/img/textures/fadeinlonghalf.gif</span>
        but you can pick whatever you want
        go wild
        they apply to each chain individiually so you can have different backgrounds for different parts of your dialogue

howls
    moth
        what are you a wolf or something?
        kidding
        howls are a way to play sounds in the dialogue
        they're the only kind of <span class="code">EXEC::</span> command that you can use without disabling your mindspike's safeties
        you can use them like this:<br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXEC::play("muiScanner", 0.5, 1)</code>
        the first argument is the sound name, the second is the rate, and the third is the volume.
        that one sounds like this
            EXEC::play("muiScanner", 0.5, 1)
        'rate' is a relative number of how fast and high pitched a sound plays
        so like, 0.5 will be half speed and half pitch
        and 2 will be double speed and double pitch
        obviously 1 would be normal

        you'll have to try them out yourself to see what they sound like
        but here's a list of every howl i know of
        ${Object.keys((window.sfxmap as any)._sprite).map((sfx) => `<span class="code">${sfx}</span>`).join(", ")}
        all the ones with numbers are 'variants'
        so if you give <span class="code">play("talksignal")</span> for example
        it will play a random variant of the talksignal sound
        or you could put the number in there too if you only wanted the one.

customhowls

        custom howls are pretty complicated
        so complicated i cant really explain them here
        youre better off asking <span class="code">@craftxbox</span> on the <a class="code" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/corru">discord</a> about them
        i can show you an example though
        <code>example = new Howl({<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;src: ["https://corru.observer/audio/ozoloop.ogg"],<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;rate: 2,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;volume: 0.5,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;loop: true<br/>});</code>
        and then you'd use that in a dialogue like this:<br/><br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXEC::example.play()</code>

        <span class="code">SHOWIF::</span> is a standard command that lets you show a dialogue line or response only if a certain condition is met
        usually this would be if the player has seen an entity or dialogue or whatever before.
        as an example:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">SHOWIF::[["whatever"], ["example", "testing"]]</span>
        this will only show if the 'whatever' flag  is anything but false, and the 'example' flag is specifically only "testing"
        typically you would use these for seeing if a branch has been seen before
        the way you do that is by using <span class="code">fbx__chainname_branchname</span> as the key.
        the default chain is <span class="code">editorpreview</span>, so if you wanted to see if the player has seen the 'start' branch of that chain, you would use <span class="code">fbx__editorpreview_start</span>
        but since its shared you might want to use a custom chain to avoid conflicts
        internally, showif calls the check() function, so there are a lot of flags you can check for
        unfortunately i don't have the time to explain them all here
        anyway, SHOWIF:: can also be used as a special 'root command' instead of on a single dialogue line
        instead of giving it three levels of indentation, you give it zero levels and instead add four underscores before it
        like this:<br/><br/><code>____SHOWIF::[["whatever"], ["example", "testing"]]</code>
        then, it will apply to everything past it, until you add a <span class="code">____END</span> or another <span class="code">____SHOWIF::</span>
        this can be helpful to avoid repeating the same SHOWIF:: command over and over again
        <span class="code">NESTIF::</span> is a similar command, but you can put multiple of them inside each other
        each of them will go up until the next ____END 
        heres an example of everything, i wasn't sure how best to demonstrate it: <br/><br/>start<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always seen<br/>____SHOWIF::[["test1"]]<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if test1<br/>____END<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always seen<br/>____NESTIF::[["test2"]]<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if test2<br/>____NESTIF::[["test3"]]<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if test3 and test2<br/>____END<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if test2<br/>____END<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always seen

        who made this?
    moth
        oh, uh, obviously this isnt an official thing, corruworks didn't make this and probably hasn't even seen it.
        so don't bug them about it, or take anything here as official canon.
    
    craftxbox
        My name is craftxbox, I made this dialogue editor (and the tutorial dialogue you're reading right now).
        I hope you find it useful, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me on the corru.observer discord server.
        You can find the full source code for it here:<br/><a class="code" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/craftxbox/corruskivi">https://github.com/craftxbox/corruskivi</a>
        I credit @ifritdiezel for their original dialogue editor, aswell as @noobogonis and @the_dem for the dialogue toolkit I used as a reference
        Obviously, @corruworks made the game itself, and all the visuals you see here. I'm only responsible for the editor itself.
        I would also like to credit @daisy_m766 for giving me the idea to make this editor in the first place.
        As well, I would like to credit all of the people who have contributed to the git repository:
